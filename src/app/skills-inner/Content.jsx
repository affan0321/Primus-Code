            <h1>The Challenge</h1>
            <p>NovaMed had grown rapidly over five years but was held back by fragmented data systems, scattered across multiple on-premise and cloud applications. Their analytics were sluggish, reports were inconsistent, and the executive team struggled to access real-time operational visibility.  Daily reporting relied on Excel sheets extracted from legacy ERP systems, leading to data redundancy, late decision-making, and minimal forecasting power. The company wanted to modernize its analytics architecture and introduce a unified data warehouse that could scale with them.</p>
            <h1>Our Approach</h1>
            <p>Primus Code‚Äôs Data & Analytics team partnered closely with NovaMed to understand every facet of their operational data.</p>
            <h1>Key Steps</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Audit & Mapping: Identified all data sources ‚Äî ERP, CRM, inventory systems, and third-party logistics APIs.</li>
                <li>ETL Pipeline Implementation: Built robust pipelines using Apache Airflow and AWS Glue for real-time ingestion and transformation.</li>
                <li>Data Warehouse Architecture: Deployed a scalable, cloud-native Snowflake data warehouse with integrated access controls and query optimization.</li>
                <li>BI Integration: Connected the warehouse with Power BI dashboards customized for Operations, Finance, and C-Suite.</li>
                <li>Training & Handover: Provided documentation, admin training, and a monitoring dashboard for internal IT teams.</li>
            </ul>
